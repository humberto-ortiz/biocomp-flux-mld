	Abstract = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

@article{ruden_genetical_2009,
	Abstract = {The genetics of gene expression in recombinant inbred lines ({RILs)} can be mapped as expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs).} So-called "genetical genomics" studies have identified locally acting {eQTLs} (cis-{eQTLs)} for genes that show differences in steady-state {RNA} levels. These studies have also identified distantly acting master-modulatory trans-{eQTLs} that regulate tens or hundreds of transcripts (hotspots or transbands). We expand on these studies by performing genetical genomics experiments in two environments in order to identify trans-{eQTL} that might be regulated by developmental exposure to the neurotoxin lead. Flies from each of 75 {RIL} were raised from eggs to adults on either control food (made with 250 {microM} sodium acetate), or lead-treated food (made with 250 {microM} lead acetate, {PbAc).} {RNA} expression analyses of whole adult male flies (5-10 days old) were performed with Affymetrix {DrosII} whole genome arrays (18,952 probesets). Among the 1389 genes with cis-{eQTL}, there were 405 genes unique to control flies and 544 genes unique to lead-treated ones (440 genes had the same cis-{eQTLs} in both samples). There are 2396 genes with trans-{eQTL} which mapped to 12 major transbands with greater than 95 genes. Permutation analyses of the strain labels but not the expression data suggests that the total number of {eQTL} and the number of transbands are more important criteria for validation than the size of the transband. Two transbands, one located on the 2nd chromosome and one on the 3rd chromosome, co-regulate 33 lead-induced genes, many of which are involved in neurodevelopmental processes. For these 33 genes, rather than allelic variation at one locus exerting differential effects in two environments, we found that variation at two different loci are required for optimal effects on lead-induced expression.},

	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing data from non-normalized samples offer unique opportunities to study the metabolic states of organisms. One can deduce gene expression levels using sequence coverage as a surrogate, identify coding changes or discover novel isoforms or transcripts. Especially for discovery of novel events, de novo assembly of transcriptomes is desirable.


{RESULTS}

Transcriptome from tumor tissue of a patient with follicular lymphoma was sequenced with 36 base pair (bp) single- and paired-end reads on the Illumina Genome Analyzer {II} platform. We assembled approximately 194 million reads using {ABySS} into 66 921 contigs 100 bp or longer, with a maximum contig length of 10 951 bp, representing over 30 million base pairs of unique transcriptome sequence, or roughly 1\% of the genome. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION:} Source code and binaries of {ABySS} are freely available for download at http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss. Assembler tool is implemented in C++. The parallel version uses Open {MPI.} {ABySS-Explorer} tool is implemented in Java using the Java universal network/graph framework.

	Abstract = {{\textless}{AbstractText} {Label="BACKGROUND"} {NlmCategory="BACKGROUND"{\textgreater}The} small sample sizes often used for microarray experiments result in poor estimates of variance if each gene is considered independently. Yet accurately estimating variability of gene expression measurements in microarray experiments is essential for correctly identifying differentially expressed genes. Several recently developed methods for testing differential expression of genes utilize hierarchical Bayesian models to "pool" information from multiple genes. We have developed a statistical testing procedure that further improves upon current methods by incorporating the well-documented relationship between the absolute gene expression level and the variance of gene expression measurements into the general empirical Bayes framework.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{\textless}{AbstractText} {Label="RESULTS"} {NlmCategory="RESULTS"{\textgreater}We} present a novel Bayesian moderated-T, which we show to perform favorably in simulations, with two real, dual-channel microarray experiments and in two controlled single-channel experiments. In simulations, the new method achieved greater power while correctly estimating the true proportion of false positives, and in the analysis of two publicly-available "spike-in" experiments, the new method performed favorably compared to all tested alternatives. We also applied our method to two experimental datasets and discuss the additional biological insights as revealed by our method in contrast to the others. The R-source code for implementing our algorithm is freely available at http://eh3.uc.edu/ibmt.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{\textless}{AbstractText} {Label="CONCLUSION"} {NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{\textgreater}We} use a Bayesian hierarchical normal model to define a novel Intensity-Based Moderated T-statistic ({IBMT).} The method is completely data-dependent using empirical Bayes philosophy to estimate hyperparameters, and thus does not require specification of any free parameters. {IBMT} has the strength of balancing two important factors in the analysis of microarray data: the degree of independence of variances relative to the degree of identity (i.e. t-tests vs. equal variance assumption), and the relationship between variance and signal intensity. When this variance-intensity relationship is weak or does not exist, {IBMT} reduces to a previously described moderated t-statistic. Furthermore, our method may be directly applied to any array platform and experimental design. Together, these properties show {IBMT} to be a valuable option in the analysis of virtually any microarray experiment.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}},

Until now, such genome-wide {RNAi} screens have mostly been restricted to cultured cells and ubiquitous gene inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans. This powerful approach has not yet been applied in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report the generation and validation of a genome-wide library of Drosophila melanogaster {RNAi} transgenes, enabling the conditional inactivation of gene function in specific tissues of the intact organism. Our {RNAi} transgenes consist of short gene fragments cloned as inverted repeats and expressed using the binary {GAL4/UAS} system. We generated 22,270 transgenic lines, covering 88\% of the predicted protein-coding genes in the Drosophila genome. Molecular and phenotypic assays indicate that the majority of these transgenes are functional. Our transgenic {RNAi} library thus opens up the prospect of systematically analysing gene functions in any tissue and at any stage of the Drosophila lifespan.},

Nature, impact and mutual interference of biases in different experimental setups are, however, still poorly understood---mostly due to the lack of data from intermediate protocol steps. We analysed multiple {RNA-Seq} experiments, involving different sample preparation protocols and sequencing platforms: we broke them down into their common---and currently indispensable---technical components (reverse transcription, fragmentation, adapter ligation, {PCR} amplification, gel segregation and sequencing), investigating how such different steps influence abundance and distribution of the sequenced reads. For each of those steps, we developed universally applicable models, which can be parameterised by empirical attributes of any experimental protocol. Our models are implemented in a computer simulation pipeline called the Flux Simulator, and we show that read distributions generated by different combinations of these models reproduce well corresponding evidence obtained from the corresponding experimental setups. We further demonstrate that our in silico {RNA-Seq} provides insights about hidden precursors that determine the final configuration of reads along gene bodies; enhancing or compensatory effects that explain apparently controversial observations can be observed. Moreover, our simulations identify hitherto unreported sources of systematic bias from {RNA} hydrolysis, a fragmentation technique currently employed by most {RNA-Seq} protocols.},

@article{navon_novel_2009,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs)} regulate target genes at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and development. Variation amongst individuals is a significant confounding factor in {miRNA} (or other) expression studies. The true character of biologically or clinically meaningful differential expression can be obscured by inter-patient variation. In this study we aim to identify {miRNAs} with consistent differential expression in multiple tumor types using a novel data analysis approach.


{METHODS}

Using microarrays we profiled the expression of more than 700 {miRNAs} in 28 matched tumor/normal samples from 8 different tumor types (breast, colon, liver, lung, lymphoma, ovary, prostate and testis). This set is unique in putting emphasis on minimizing tissue type and patient related variability using normal and tumor samples from the same patient. We develop scores for comparing {miRNA} expression in the above matched sample data based on a rigorous characterization of the distribution of order statistics over a discrete state set, including exact p-values. Specifically, we compute a Rank Consistency Score ({RCoS)} for every {miRNA} measured in our data. Our methods are also applicable in various other contexts. We compare our methods, as applied to matched samples, to paired t-test and to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.


{RESULTS}

We identify consistent (across the cancer types measured) differentially expressed {miRNAs.} 41 {miRNAs} are under-expressed in cancer compared to normal, at {FDR} (False Discovery Rate) of 0.05 and 17 are over-expressed at the same {FDR} level. Differentially expressed {miRNAs} include known {oncomiRs} (e.g {miR-96)} as well as {miRNAs} that were not previously universally associated with cancer. Specific examples include {miR-133b} and {miR-486-5p}, which are consistently down regulated and mir-629* which is consistently up regulated in cancer, in the context of our cohort. Data is available in {GEO.} Software is available at: {http://bioinfo.cs.technion.ac.il/people/zohar/RCoS/}},

	Abstract = {{SUMMARY:} It is expected that emerging digital gene expression ({DGE)} technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. {edgeR} is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {AVAILABILITY:} The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

	Abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used {DNA} microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of {BRCA1} carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

A common shortcoming of the available tools is their inability to efficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual human genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation, we developed {ABySS} (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs ≥100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68\% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.},

There are now several methods available for summarizing probe level data from the popular Affymetrix {GeneChips}, but it is difficult to identify the best method for a given inquiry. {RESULTS:} We have developed a graphical tool to evaluate summaries of Affymetrix probe level data. Plots and summary statistics offer a picture of how an expression measure performs in several important areas. This picture facilitates the comparison of competing expression measures and the selection of methods suitable for a specific investigation. The key is a benchmark data set consisting of a dilution study and a spike-in study. Because the truth is known for these data, we can identify statistical features of the data for which the expected outcome is known in advance. Those features highlighted in our suite of graphs are justified by questions of biological interest and motivated by the presence of appropriate data.},

However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp {RNA-Seq} reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site ({TSS)} or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

	Abstract = {Mouse models of social dysfunction, designed to investigate the complex genetics of social behaviors, require an objective methodology for scoring social interactions relevant to human disease symptoms. Here we describe an automated, three chambered apparatus designed to monitor social interaction in the mouse. Time spent in each chamber and the number of entries are scored automatically by a system detecting photocell beam breaks. When tested with the automated equipment, juvenile male {C57BL/6J} mice spent more time in a chamber containing a stranger mouse than in an empty chamber (sociability), similar to results obtained by the observer scored method. In addition, automated scoring detected a preference to spend more time with an unfamiliar stranger than a more familiar conspecific (preference for social novelty), similar to results obtained by the observer scored method. Sniffing directed at the wire cage containing the stranger mouse correlated significantly with time spent in that chamber, indicating that duration in a chamber represents true social approach behavior. Number of entries between chambers did not correlate with duration of time spent in the chambers; entries instead proved a useful control measure of general activity. The most significant social approach behavior took place in the first five minutes of both the sociability and preference for social novelty tests. Application of these methods to {C57BL/6J}, {DBA/2J} and {FVB/NJ} adult males revealed that all three strains displayed tendencies for sociability and preference for social novelty. To evaluate the importance of the strain of the stranger mouse on sociability and preference for social novelty, {C57BL/6J} subject mice were tested either with {A/J} strangers or with {C57BL/6J} strangers. Sociability and preference for social novelty were similar with both stranger strains. The automated equipment provides an accurate and objective approach to measuring social tendencies in mice. Its use may allow higher-throughput scoring of mouse social behaviors in mouse models of social dysfunction.},

In addition, double immunofluorescence analyses showed that amygdalar Fen-1 expression is mostly localized within neurons. Importantly, functional studies demonstrated that amygdalar antisense knockdown of fen-1 expression impaired consolidation, but not short-term memory, of {CTA.} Overall, these studies define the fen-1 endonuclease as a new {DNA} recombination/repair factor involved in the formation of long-term memories.},

@article{santangelo_what_2005,
	Abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic origins, with a heritability of about 90\%. Autistic disorder is classed within the broad domain of pervasive developmental disorders ({PDD)} that also includes Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger syndrome, and {PDD} not otherwise specified ({PDD-NOS).} Prevalence estimates suggest a rate of 0.1-0.2\% for autism and 0.6\% for the range of {PDD} disorders. There is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity within this class of disorders as well as continued debate regarding their clinical boundaries. Autism is the prototypical {PDD}, and is characterized by impairments in three core domains: social interaction, language development, and patterns of behavior (restricted and stereotyped). Clinical pattern and severity of impairment vary along these dimensions, and the level of cognitive functioning of individuals with autism spans the entire range, from profound mental retardation to superior intellect. There is no single biological or clinical marker for autism, nor is it expected that a single gene is responsible for its expression; as many as 15+ genes may be involved. However, environmental influences are also important, as concordance in monozygotic twins is less than 100\% and the phenotypic expression of the disorder varies widely, even within monozygotic twins. Multiple susceptibility factors are being explored using varied methodologies, including genome-wide linkage studies, and family- and case-control candidate gene association studies. This paper reviews what is currently known about the genetic and environmental risk factors, neuropathology, and psychopharmacology of autism. Discussion of genetic factors focuses on the findings from linkage and association studies, the results of which have implicated the involvement of nearly every chromosome in the human genome. However, the most consistently replicated linkage findings have been on chromosome 7q, 2q, and 15q. The positive associations from candidate gene studies are largely unreplicated, with the possible exceptions of the {GABRB3} and serotonin transporter genes. No single region of the brain or pathophysiological mechanism has yet been identified as being associated with autism. Postmortem findings, animal models, and neuroimaging studies have focused on the cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and especially the amygdala. The cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit may also be influential in autism. There is evidence that overall brain size is increased in some individuals with autism. Presently there are no drugs that produce major improvements in the core social or pragmatic language deficits in autism, although several have limited effects on associated behavioral features. The application of new techniques in autism research is being proposed, including the investigation of abnormal regulation of gene expression, proteomics, and the use of {MRI} and postmortem analysis of the brain.},

@article{rausch_consistency-based_2009,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Novel high-throughput sequencing technologies pose new algorithmic challenges in handling massive amounts of short-read, high-coverage data. A robust and versatile consensus tool is of particular interest for such data since a sound multi-read alignment is a prerequisite for variation analyses, accurate genome assemblies and insert sequencing.
Results: A multi-read alignment algorithm for de novo or reference-guided genome assembly is presented. The program identifies segments shared by multiple reads and then aligns these segments using a consistency-enhanced alignment graph. On real de novo sequencing data obtained from the newly established {NCBI} Short Read Archive, the program performs similarly in quality to other comparable programs. On more challenging simulated datasets for insert sequencing and variation analyses, our program outperforms the other tools.
Availability: The consensus program can be downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/consensus.html. It can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with the Celera Assembler. Both application scenarios as well as the usage of the tool are described in the documentation.

	Abstract = {The subplate zone is a highly dynamic transient sector of the developing cerebral cortex that contains some of the earliest generated neurons and the first functional synapses of the cerebral cortex. Subplate cells have important functions in early establishment and maturation of thalamocortical connections, as well as in the development of inhibitory cortical circuits in sensory areas. So far no role has been identified for cells in the subplate in the mature brain and disease association of the subplate-specific genes has not been analyzed systematically. Here we present gene expression evidence for distinct roles of the mouse subplate across development as well as unique molecular markers to extend the repertoire of subplate labels. Performing systematic comparisons between different ages (embryonic days 15 and 18, postnatal day 8, and adult), we reveal the dynamic and constant features of the markers labeling subplate cells during embryonic and early postnatal development and in the adult. This can be visualized using the online database of subplate gene expression at https://molnar.dpag.ox.ac.uk/subplate/. We also identify embryonic similarities in gene expression between the ventricular zones, intermediate zone, and subplate, and distinct postnatal similarities between subplate, layer 5, and layers 2/3. The genes expressed in a subplate-specific manner at some point during development show a statistically significant enrichment for association with autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Our report emphasizes the importance of the study of transient features of the developing brain to better understand neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to {DNA} damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

	Abstract = {Background
A 70-gene tumor expression profile was established as a powerful predictor of disease outcome in young breast cancer patients. This profile, however, was generated on microarrays containing 25,000 60-mer oligonucleotides that are not designed for processing of many samples on a routine basis.

Results
To facilitate its use in a diagnostic setting, the 70-gene prognosis profile was translated into a customized microarray ({MammaPrint)} containing a reduced set of 1,900 probes suitable for high throughput processing. {RNA} of 162 patient samples from two previous studies was subjected to hybridization to this custom array to validate the prognostic value. Classification results obtained from the original analysis were then compared to those generated using the algorithms based on the custom microarray and showed an extremely high correlation of prognosis prediction between the original data and those generated using the custom mini-array (p {\textless} 0.0001).

Conclusion
In this report we demonstrate for the first time that microarray technology can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool. The data clearly demonstrate the reproducibility and robustness of the small custom-made microarray. The array is therefore an excellent tool to predict outcome of disease in breast cancer patients.},

@article{cuvelier_targeted_2010,
	Abstract = {Among eukaryotes, four major phytoplankton lineages are responsible for marine photosynthesis; prymnesiophytes, alveolates, stramenopiles, and prasinophytes. Contributions by individual taxa, however, are not well known, and genomes have been analyzed from only the latter two lineages. Tiny ``picoplanktonic'' members of the prymnesiophyte lineage have long been inferred to be ecologically important but remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine pico-prymnesiophyte evolutionary history and ecology using cultivation-independent methods. {18S} {rRNA} gene analysis showed pico-prymnesiophytes belonged to broadly distributed uncultivated taxa. Therefore, we used targeted metagenomics to analyze uncultured pico-prymnesiophytes sorted by flow cytometry from subtropical North Atlantic waters. The data reveal a composite nuclear-encoded gene repertoire with strong green-lineage affiliations, which contrasts with the evolutionary history indicated by the plastid genome. Measured pico-prymnesiophyte growth rates were rapid in this region, resulting in primary production contributions similar to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. On average, pico-prymnesiophytes formed 25\% of global picophytoplankton biomass, with differing contributions in five biogeographical provinces spanning tropical to subpolar systems. Elements likely contributing to success include high gene density and genes potentially involved in defense and nutrient uptake. Our findings have implications reaching beyond pico-prymnesiophytes, to the prasinophytes and stramenopiles. For example, prevalence of putative Ni-containing superoxide dismutases ({SODs)}, instead of Fe-containing {SODs}, seems to be a common adaptation among eukaryotic phytoplankton for reducing Fe quotas in low-Fe modern oceans. Moreover, highly mosaic gene repertoires, although compositionally distinct for each major eukaryotic lineage, now seem to be an underlying facet of successful marine phytoplankton.},

@article{haiman_characterizing_2011,
	Abstract = {{GWAS} of prostate cancer have been remarkably successful in revealing common genetic variants and novel biological pathways that are linked with its etiology. A more complete understanding of inherited susceptibility to prostate cancer in the general population will come from continuing such discovery efforts and from testing known risk alleles in diverse racial and ethnic groups. In this large study of prostate cancer in African American men (3,425 prostate cancer cases and 3,290 controls), we tested 49 risk variants located in 28 genomic regions identified through {GWAS} in men of European and Asian descent, and we replicated associations (at p≤0.05) with roughly half of these markers. Through fine-mapping, we identified nearby markers in many regions that better define associations in African Americans. At 8q24, we found 9 variants (p≤6×10(-4)) that best capture risk of prostate cancer in African Americans, many of which are more common in men of African than European descent. The markers found to be associated with risk at each locus improved risk modeling in African Americans (per allele {OR} = 1.17) over the alleles reported in the original {GWAS} ({OR} = 1.08). In summary, in this detailed analysis of the prostate cancer risk loci reported from {GWAS}, we have validated and improved upon markers of risk in some regions that better define the association with prostate cancer in African Americans. Our findings with variants at 8q24 also reinforce the importance of this region as a major risk locus for prostate cancer in men of African ancestry.},

@article{hertz-picciotto_charge_2006,
	Abstract = {Causes and contributing factors for autism are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that prevalence is rising, but the extent to which diagnostic changes and improvements in ascertainment contribute to this increase is unclear. Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to contribute etiologically. Evidence from twin, family, and genetic studies supports a role for an inherited predisposition to the development of autism. Nonetheless, clinical, neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic, and epidemiologic studies suggest that gene penetrance and expression may be influenced, in some cases strongly, by the prenatal and early postnatal environmental milieu. Sporadic studies link autism to xenobiotic chemicals and/or viruses, but few methodologically rigorous investigations have been undertaken. In light of major gaps in understanding of autism, a large case-control investigation of underlying environmental and genetic causes for autism and triggers of regression has been launched. The {CHARGE} (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) study will address a wide spectrum of chemical and biologic exposures, susceptibility factors, and their interactions. Phenotypic variation among children with autism will be explored, as will similarities and differences with developmental delay. The {CHARGE} study infrastructure includes detailed developmental assessments, medical information, questionnaire data, and biologic specimens. The {CHARGE} study is linked to University of California-Davis Center for Children's Environmental Health laboratories in immunology, xenobiotic measurement, cell signaling, genomics, and proteomics. The goals, study design, and data collection protocols are described, as well as preliminary demographic data on study participants and on diagnoses of those recruited through the California Department of Developmental Services Regional Center System.},

@article{adams_mercury_2007,
	Abstract = {This study determined the level of mercury, lead, and zinc in baby teeth of children with autism spectrum disorder (n = 15, age 6.1 +/- 2.2 yr) and typically developing children (n = 11, age = 7 +/- 1.7 yr). Children with autism had significantly (2.1-fold) higher levels of mercury but similar levels of lead and similar levels of zinc. Children with autism also had significantly higher usage of oral antibiotics during their first 12 mo of life, and possibly higher usage of oral antibiotics during their first 36 mo of life. Baby teeth are a good measure of cumulative exposure to toxic metals during fetal development and early infancy, so this study suggests that children with autism had a higher body burden of mercury during fetal/infant development. Antibiotic use is known to almost completely inhibit excretion of mercury in rats due to alteration of gut flora. Thus, higher use of oral antibiotics in the children with autism may have reduced their ability to excrete mercury, and hence may partially explain the higher level in baby teeth. Higher usage of oral antibiotics in infancy may also partially explain the high incidence of chronic gastrointestinal problems in individuals with autism.},

	Abstract = {One bottleneck in large-scale genome sequencing projects is reconstructing the full genome sequence from the short subsequences produced by current technologies. The final stages of the genome assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper presents our design decisions in translating key data features identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local sequence errors making high-level inspection of the assembly difficult if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display, {ABySS-Explorer}, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks, and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality of this encoding for {DNA} sequence data.},

@article{hirsch_variations_2009,
	Abstract = {We developed Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study correlated behavioral, neuronal and genetic effects of the neurotoxin lead, known to affect cognitive and behavioral development in children. We showed that, as in vertebrates, lead affects both synaptic development and complex behaviors (courtship, fecundity, locomotor activity) in Drosophila. By assessing differential behavioral responses to developmental lead exposure among recombinant inbred Drosophila lines ({RI)}, derived from parental lines Oregon R and Russian 2b, we have now identified a genotype by environment interaction ({GEI)} for a behavioral trait affected by lead. Drosophila Activity Monitors ({TriKinetics}, Waltham, {MA)}, which measure activity by counting the number of times a single fly in a small glass tube walks through an infrared beam aimed at the middle of the tube, were used to measure activity of flies, reared from eggs to 4 days of adult age on either control or lead-contaminated medium, from each of 75 {RI} lines. We observed a significant statistical association between the effect of lead on Average Daytime Activity ({ADA)} across lines and one marker locus, {30AB}, on chromosome 2; we define this as a Quantitative Trait Locus ({QTL)} associated with behavioral effects of developmental lead exposure. When {30AB} was from Russian 2b, lead significantly increased locomotor activity, whereas, when {30AB} was from Oregon R, lead decreased it. {30AB} contains about 125 genes among which are likely "candidate genes" for the observed lead-dependent behavioral changes. Drosophila are thus a useful, underutilized model for studying behavioral, synaptic and genetic changes following chronic exposure to lead or other neurotoxins during development.},

@article{akins_evaluation_1992,
	Abstract = {Heavy metals cause irreversible neurobehavioral damage in many developing mammals, but the mechanisms of this damage are unknown. The influence of three heavy metal compounds, triethyllead chloride, lead acetate and cadmium chloride, on lethality, development, behavior and learning was studied using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This animal was used because it allows hundreds of subjects to be assayed very easily in individual experiments and because it is a system in which toxicological questions might be answered by using the techniques of modern molecular genetics. When triethyllead chloride, lead acetate or cadmium chloride was placed in the medium, the larval {LC50} (+/- standard error) was found to be 0.090 +/- 0.004, 6.60 +/- 0.64 and 0.42 +/- 0.04 {mM}, respectively. Each of the tested compounds produced a dose-related delay in development. In particular, they caused a delay in the development of larvae to pupae. When larvae were reared on medium containing triethyllead chloride (0.06 {mM)}, lead acetate (3.07 {mM)} or cadmium chloride (0.11 {mM)}, phototaxis, locomotion and learning were not inhibited. Since significant neurobehavioral effects were not observed under the experimental conditions used, Drosophila does not appear to be an appropriate animal for the genetic dissection of such effects of heavy metals during development.},

	Note = {Tor is a popular low-latency anonymity network. However, Tor does not protect against the exploitation of an insecure application to reveal the {IP} address of, or trace, a {TCP} stream. In addition, because of the linkability of Tor streams sent together over a single circuit, tracing one stream sent over a circuit traces them all. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this linkability allows in practice to trace a significant number of streams originating from secure (i.e., proxied) applications. In this paper, we show that linkability allows us to trace 193\% of additional streams, including 27\% of {HTTP} streams possibly originating from ``secure'' browsers. In particular, we traced 9\% of Tor streams carried by our instrumented exit nodes. Using {BitTorrent} as the insecure application, we design two attacks tracing {BitTorrent} users on Tor. We run these attacks in the wild for 23 days and reveal 10,000 {IP} addresses of Tor users. Using these {IP} addresses, we then profile not only the {BitTorrent} downloads but also the websites visited per country of origin of Tor users. We show that {BitTorrent} users on Tor are over-represented in some countries as compared to {BitTorrent} users outside of Tor. By analyzing the type of content downloaded, we then explain the observed behaviors by the higher concentration of pornographic content downloaded at the scale of a country. Finally, we present results suggesting the existence of an underground {BitTorrent} ecosystem on Tor.},

@article{jett_age-dependent_1997,
	Abstract = {The neurobehavioral toxicity of developmental exposure to lead (Pb) was investigated by conducting tests of spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Female Long-Evans rats were exposed to 0 or 250 ppm Pb acetate in the diet beginning 10 days prior to breeding and continued throughout gestation and lactation. Pups were weaned onto the same diets as the dams at postnatal day 20 ({PN20).} Increased levels of Pb were detected in the hippocampus of the 250 ppm Pb acetate group relative to controls. The highest concentration of Pb measured in the hippocampus was at {PN21} with decreasing levels at older ages. In the Morris Water Maze, a statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.03; female rats) or near significant (p {\textless} 0.07; male rats) increase in the time required to find the hidden platform (escape latency) was observed when Pb-treated rats were tested in a reference memory paradigm. This effect was only observed when rats were tested at {PN21} and not at older ages. No significant effects of developmental Pb exposure were measured when rats were tested in a working memory paradigm of the Morris water maze at any age. These initial studies indicate an impairment of performance in the swim task in {PN21} rats exposed to Pb during development. The age-dependent effect of Pb in this learning paradigm is consistent with previous studies in experimental animals and with the observation that children are more susceptible to Pb-induced cognitive deficits than adults. The Morris water maze may be useful for studying the effects of Pb on learning and memory, and their neurochemical basis.},

	Abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression ({DGE)} technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. {edgeR} is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	Abstract = {The genetics of gene expression in recombinant inbred lines ({RILs)} can be mapped as expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs).} So-called ``genetical genomics'' studies have identified locally-acting {eQTLs} (cis-{eQTLs)} for genes that show differences in steady state {RNA} levels. These studies have also identified distantly-acting master-modulatory trans-{eQTLs} that regulate tens or hundreds of transcripts (hotspots or transbands). We expand on these studies by performing genetical genomics experiments in two environments in order to identify trans-{eQTL} that might be regulated by developmental exposure to the neurotoxin lead. Flies from each of 75 {RIL} were raised from eggs to adults on either control food (made with 250 {µM} sodium acetate), or lead-treated food (made with 250 {µM} lead acetate, {PbAc).} {RNA} expression analyses of whole adult male flies (5--10 days old) were performed with Affymetrix {DrosII} whole genome arrays (18,952 probesets). Among the 1,389 genes with cis-{eQTL}, there were 405 genes unique to control flies and 544 genes unique to lead-treated ones (440 genes had the same cis-{eQTLs} in both samples). There are 2,396 genes with trans-{eQTL} which mapped to 12 major transbands with greater than 95 genes. Permutation analyses of the strain labels but not the expression data suggests that the total number of {eQTL} and the number of transbands are more important criteria for validation than the size of the transband. Two transbands, one located on the 2nd chromosome and one on the 3rd chromosome, co-regulate 33 lead-induced genes, many of which are involved in neurodevelopmental processes. For these 33 genes, rather than allelic variation at one locus exerting differential effects in two environments, we found that variation at two different loci are required for optimal effects on lead-induced expression.},

To help establish the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model system for studying such disruption, we describe effects of Pb(2+) on hormonally regulated traits. These include duration of development, longevity, females' willingness to mate, fecundity and adult locomotor activity. Developmental Pb(2+) exposure has been shown to affect gene expression in a specific region of the Drosophila genome (approximately 122 genes) involved in lead-induced changes in adult locomotion and to affect regulation of intracellular calcium levels associated with neuronal activity at identified synapses in the larval neuromuscular junction. We suggest ways in which Drosophila could become a new model system for the study of endocrine disruptors at genetic, neural and behavioral levels of analysis, particularly by use of genomic methods. This will facilitate efforts to distinguish between behavioral effects of Pb(2+) caused by direct action on neural mechanisms versus effects of Pb(+2) on behavior mediated through endocrine disruption.},

	Abstract = {Lead (Pb(2+)) is a ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicant that continues to threaten public health on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated detrimental effects of Pb(2+) on childhood {IQ} at very low levels of exposure. Recently, a mechanistic understanding of how Pb(2+) affects brain development has begun to emerge. The cognitive effects of Pb(2+) exposure are believed to be mediated through its selective inhibition of the N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor ({NMDAR).} Studies in animal models of developmental Pb(2+) exposure exhibit altered {NMDAR} subunit ontogeny and disruption of {NMDAR-dependent} intracellular signaling. Additional studies have reported that Pb(2+) exposure inhibits presynaptic calcium (Ca(2+)) channels and affects presynaptic neurotransmission, but a mechanistic link between presynaptic and postsynaptic effects has been missing. Recent work has suggested that the presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of Pb(2+) exposure are both due to inhibition of the {NMDAR} by Pb(2+), and that the presynaptic effects of Pb(2+) may be mediated by disruption of {NMDAR} activity-dependent signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF).} These findings provide the basis for the first working model to describe the effects of Pb(2+) exposure on synaptic function. Here, we review the neurotoxic effects of Pb(2+) exposure and discuss the known effects of Pb(2+) exposure in light of these recent findings.},

	Abstract = {Repair and regeneration are key processes for tissue maintenance, and their disruption may lead to disease states. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underline the repair and regeneration of the digestive tract. The sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima represents an excellent model to dissect and characterize the molecular events during intestinal regeneration. To study the gene expression profile, {cDNA} libraries were constructed from normal, 3-day, and 7-day regenerating intestines of H. glaberrima. Clones were randomly sequenced and queried against the nonredundant protein database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. {RT-PCR} analyses were made of several genes to determine their expression profile during intestinal regeneration. A total of 5,173 sequences from three {cDNA} libraries were obtained. About 46.2, 35.6, and 26.2\% of the sequences for the normal, 3-days, and 7-days {cDNA} libraries, respectively, shared significant similarity with known sequences in the protein database of {GenBank} but only present 10\% of similarity among them. Analysis of the libraries in terms of functional processes, protein domains, and most common sequences suggests that a differential expression profile is taking place during the regeneration process. Further examination of the expressed sequence tag dataset revealed that 12 putative genes are differentially expressed at significant level (R {\textgreater} 6). Experimental validation by {RT-PCR} analysis reveals that at least three genes (unknown C-4677-1, melanotransferrin, and centaurin) present a differential expression during regeneration. These findings strongly suggest that the gene expression profile varies among regeneration stages and provide evidence for the existence of differential gene expression.},

	Abstract = {Background
Differential expression detection for {RNA-seq} experiments is often biased by normalization algorithms due to their sensitivity to parametric assumptions on the gene count distributions, extreme values of gene expression, gene length and total number of sequence reads.

Results
To overcome limitations of current methodologies, we developed Differential Feature Index ({DFI)}, a non-parametric method for characterizing distinctive gene features across any number of diverse {RNA-seq} experiments without inter-sample normalization. Validated with {qRT-PCR} datasets, {DFI} accurately detected differentially expressed genes regardless of expression levels and consistent with tissue selective expression. Accuracy of {DFI} was very similar to the currently accepted methods: {EdgeR}, {DESeq} and Cuffdiff.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated that {DFI} can efficiently handle multiple groups of data simultaneously, and identify differential gene features for {RNA-Seq} experiments from different laboratories, tissue types, and cell origins, and is robust to extreme values of gene expression, size of the datasets and gene length.},

	Abstract = {Highly polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule ({PSA-NCAM)} is transiently expressed specifically in newly generated cells, and is important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth. Developmental lead (Pb) exposure has been considered to affect the expression of {PSA-NCAM}, which contributes to the neurotoxicity of Pb exposure. However, the effect of maternal low-level Pb exposure on the expression of {PSA-NCAM} in neonatal rat pups has not been reported. In the present study, female Wistar rats were exposed to vehicle or different dosages of lead chloride (0.5-{4mM} {PbCl2)} 2 weeks before and during pregnancy. This exposure protocol resulted in neonatal rat pups blood Pb levels up to 12.12+/-0.38 microg/dl, and hippocampal Pb levels up to 9.22+/-0.81 microg/g at postnatal day 1 ({PND} 1). Immunohistochemistry analysis and Western blot analysis revealed that the expressions of {PSA-NCAM} and {NCAM} in the hippocampi of neonatal rat pups at {PND} 1 were significantly reduced by the maternal low-level Pb exposures. Furthermore, the {mRNA} levels of {NCAM} and polysialyltransferases ({STX} and {PST)}, measured by the fluorescent real-time quantitative {RT-PCR}, dosage-dependently and significantly decreased by 13.26-37.62\%, 25.17-59.67\%, and 10.78-47.81\%, respectively. In addition, the sialyltransferase activity in neonatal rat pups was significantly reduced by 6.23-32.50\% in the presence of the low-level Pb exposure, too. Taken together, these results suggest that maternal low-level Pb exposure reduces the expression of {PSA-NCAM}, {NCAM}, and the activity of sialyltransferase in the hippocampi of neonatal rat pups, which might contribute to the learning and memory impairments in the developmental pups following maternal low-level Pb exposure.},

	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

An important problem in systems biology is the inference of biochemical pathways and regulatory networks from postgenomic data. Various reverse engineering methods have been proposed in the literature, and it is important to understand their relative merits and shortcomings. In the present paper, we compare the accuracy of reconstructing gene regulatory networks with three different modelling and inference paradigms: (1) Relevance networks ({RNs):} pairwise association scores independent of the remaining network; (2) graphical Gaussian models ({GGMs):} undirected graphical models with constraint-based inference, and (3) Bayesian networks ({BNs):} directed graphical models with score-based inference. The evaluation is carried out on the Raf pathway, a cellular signalling network describing the interaction of 11 phosphorylated proteins and phospholipids in human immune system cells. We use both laboratory data from cytometry experiments as well as data simulated from the gold-standard network. We also compare passive observations with active interventions.


{RESULTS}

On Gaussian observational data, {BNs} and {GGMs} were found to outperform {RNs.} The difference in performance was not significant for the non-linear simulated data and the cytoflow data, though. Also, we did not observe a significant difference between {BNs} and {GGMs} on observational data in general. However, for interventional data, {BNs} outperform {GGMs} and {RNs}, especially when taking the edge directions rather than just the skeletons of the graphs into account. This suggests that the higher computational costs of inference with {BNs} over {GGMs} and {RNs} are not justified when using only passive observations, but that active interventions in the form of gene knockouts and over-expressions are required to exploit the full potential of {BNs.}

	Abstract = {The embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is required for the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Transcripts from this locus are distributed ubiquitously throughout the nervous system at all developmental stages. A product of this gene, the {ELAV} protein, has homology to known {RNA} binding proteins. The localization of the {ELAV} protein was studied in all developmental stages using antibodies that were generated against a hybrid protein made in Escherichia coli. In general, these data are consistent with previous results and demonstrate that (1) the {ELAV} protein is detected in the developing embryonic nervous system at a time coincident with the birth of the first neurons, (2) the {ELAV} protein is first detected in the majority of neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems of embryos, larvae, pupae, and adults, (3) the {ELAV} protein appears to be localized to the nucleus, and (4) the {ELAV} protein is not detected in neuroblasts or identifiable glia. These data also provide new information concerning elav expression and show that (1) {ELAV} is not expressed in the ganglion mother cells ({GMCs)}, (2) while the {ELAV} protein is localized to the nucleus, it is not uniformly distributed throughout this structure, and (3) other Drosophila species do express an {ELAV-like} antigen. We propose that the elav gene provides a neuronal-housekeeping function that is required for the successful posttranscriptional processing of transcripts from a set of genes the function of which is required for proper neuronal development and maintenance.},

Since the network is typically complex, with multiple connections between pathways and important feedback loops, it is crucial to represent it in the form of a computational model that can be used for a rigorous analysis. This is the approach of systems biology, made possible by new -omics data generation technologies. The goal of this review is to illustrate this approach and its utility for our understanding of cancer. After a discussion of recent progress using a network-centric approach, three case studies related to diagnostics, therapy, and drug development are presented in detail. They focus on breast cancer, B-cell lymphomas, and colorectal cancer. The discussion is centered on key mathematical and computational tools common to a systems biology approach.},

To characterize these discrete domains an analysis of Drosophila coiled bodies was initiated. The polyclonal antibody R288 raised against human coilin was used to identify coiled bodies in cells of the Drosophila larval central nervous system. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry showed that, similar to vertebrate and plant systems, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins are enriched within these structures. Further analysis of {ELAV} revealed that subnuclear domains enriched with this molecule localize within and close to coiled bodies and close to subnuclear domains enriched with splicing factors. A preliminary analysis aimed at defining a region within {ELAV} that may mediate a molecular or functional interaction important for its subnuclear localization revealed that deletion of the {ELAV} alanine/glutamine-rich amino-terminal auxiliary domain has no discernible effect on localization and that proteins produced from elav lethal alleles distribute normally.},

	Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders ({ASD)} are diagnosed on the basis of three behavioral features namely deficits in social communication, absence or delay in language, and stereotypy. The susceptibility genes to {ASD} remain largely unknown, but two major pathways are emerging. Mutations in {TSC1/TSC2}, {NF1}, or {PTEN} activate the {mTOR/PI3K} pathway and lead to syndromic {ASD} with tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, or macrocephaly. Mutations in {NLGN3/4}, {SHANK3}, or {NRXN1} alter synaptic function and lead to mental retardation, typical autism, or Asperger syndrome. The {mTOR/PI3K} pathway is associated with abnormal cellular/synaptic growth rate, whereas the {NRXN-NLGN-SHANK} pathway is associated with synaptogenesis and imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory currents. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that abnormal synaptic homeostasis represent a risk factor to {ASD.}},

@article{murphy_8q24_2012,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Multiple genetic studies have confirmed associations of 8q24 variants with susceptibility to prostate cancer ({CaP).} However, the magnitude of risk conferred in men living in West Africa is unknown.


{METHODS}

Here we determine the prevalence of 8q24 risk alleles and test for association with {CaP} risk alleles in West African ({WA)} descent populations from rural Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Caribbean island of Jamaica. Ten 8q24 {SNPs} were genotyped in histologically confirmed {CaP} cases (n = 308) and clinically evaluated controls (n = 469). In addition, unrelated individuals from Sierra Leone (n = 380) were genotyped for comparison of allele frequency comparisons.


{RESULTS}

{SNPs} rs6983561, rs7008482, and rs16901979 were significantly associated with {CaP} risk in {WAs} (P {\textless} 0.03). No associations with {CaP} were observed in our Caribbean samples. Risk alleles for rs6983267, rs7008482, and rs7000448 were highly prevalent ({\textgreater}84\%) in West Africa. We also reveal that the A-risk allele for the {'African-specific'} {SNP} bd11934905 was not observed in 1,886 chromosomes from three {WA} ethnic groups suggesting that this allele may not be common across West Africa, but is geographically restricted to specific ethnic group(s).


{CONCLUSIONS}

We provide evidence of association of 8q24 {SNPs} with prostate cancer risk in men from Nigeria and Cameroon. Our study is the first to reveal genetic risk due to 8q24 variants (in particular, region 2) with {CaP} within two {WA} countries. Most importantly, in light of the disparate burden of {CaP} in African-Americans, our findings support the need for larger genetic studies in {WA} descent populations to validate and discern function of susceptibility loci in the 8q24 region.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men in the United States, and its incidence and mortality rates are disproportionate among ethnic groups. Although genome-wide association studies of European descents have identified candidate loci associated with prostate cancer risk, including a variant in {IL16}, replication studies in African Americans ({AA)} have been inconsistent. Here we explore single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} variation in {IL16} in {AAs} and test for association with prostate cancer.


{METHODS}

Association tests were conducted for 2,257 genotyped and imputed {SNPs} spanning {IL16} in 605 {AA} prostate cancer cases and controls from Washington, {D.C.} Eleven of them were also genotyped in a replication population of 1,093 {AAs} from Chicago. We tested for allelic association adjusting for age, global and local West African ancestry.


{RESULTS}

Analyses of genotyped and imputed {SNPs} revealed that a cluster of {IL16} {SNPs} were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. The strongest association was found at rs7175701 (P = 9.8 × 10(-8)). In the Chicago population, another {SNP} (rs11556218) was associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.01). In the pooled analysis, we identified three independent loci within {IL16} that were associated with prostate cancer risk. {SNP} expression quantitative trait loci analyses revealed that rs7175701 is predicted to influence the expression of {IL16} and other cancer-related genes.


{CONCLUSION}

Our study provides evidence that {IL16} polymorphisms play a role in prostate cancer susceptibility among {AAs.} Impact: Our findings are significant given that there has been limited focus on the role of {IL16} genetic polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk in {AAs.} Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(11); 2059-68. {\copyright}2012 {AACR.}},

@article{lesch_targeted_2010,
	Abstract = {Robust mechanisms for tissue repair are critical for survival of multicellular organisms. Efficient cutaneous wound repair requires the migration of cells at the wound edge and farther back within the epidermal sheet, but the genes that control and coordinate these migrations remain obscure. This is in part because a systematic screening approach for in vivo identification and classification of postembryonic wound closure genes has yet to be developed. Here, we performed a proof-of-principle reporter-based in vivo {RNAi} screen in the Drosophila melanogaster larval epidermis to identify genes required for normal wound closure. Among the candidate genes tested were kinases and transcriptional mediators of the Jun N-terminal kinase ({JNK)} signaling pathway shown to be required for epithelial sheet migration during development. Also targeted were genes involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Importantly, {RNAi} knockdown of both canonical and noncanonical members of the {JNK} pathway caused open wounds, as did several genes involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our analysis of {JNK} pathway components reveals redundancy among the upstream activating kinases and distinct roles for the downstream transcription factors {DJun} and {DFos.} Quantitative and qualitative morphological classification of the open wound phenotypes and evaluation of {JNK} activation suggest that multiple cellular processes are required in the migrating epidermal cells, including functions specific to cells at the wound edge and others specific to cells farther back within the epidermal sheet. Together, our results identify a new set of conserved wound closure genes, determine putative functional roles for these genes within the migrating epidermal sheet, and provide a template for a broader in vivo {RNAi} screen to discover the full complement of genes required for wound closure during larval epidermal wound healing.},

	Abstract = {Long-Evans dams were exposed to Pb acetate in the drinking water during both gestation and lactation, or lactation only. This report presents the results of an automated, olfactory, serial reversal task administered to the adult offspring. Although overall learning rate was not significantly affected by Pb exposure, analyses of specific phases of the learning process revealed that all three exposed groups required significantly more trials than controls to reach criterion from the point at which perseverative responding to the previously correct cue ended. These in-depth analyses revealed that the reversal learning impairment of the Pb-exposed animals was not due to a deficit in inhibiting responses to the previously correct cue, the mechanism commonly assumed to underlie impaired reversal learning. Instead, the analyses revealed that two other independent Pb effects were responsible for the prolonged postperseverative learning period: a response bias and an impaired ability to associate cues and/or actions with affective consequences. The contribution of these two factors varied as a function of the timing and intensity of the Pb exposure. It is hypothesized that the Pb-induced associative deficit may reflect lasting damage to the amygdala and/or nucleus accumbens, which comprise a system thought to modulate the process by which environmental cues acquire affective significance.},

	Abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ({NMDAR)} ontogeny and subunit expression are altered during developmental lead (Pb²+) exposure. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur at the synaptic or cellular level. Synaptic and extra-synaptic {NMDARs} have distinct cellular roles, thus, the effects of Pb²+ on {NMDAR} synaptic targeting may affect neuronal function. In this communication, we show that Pb²+ exposure during synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons altered synaptic {NMDAR} composition, resulting in a decrease in {NR2A-containing} {NMDARs} at established synapses. Conversely, we observed increased targeting of the obligatory {NR1} subunit of the {NMDAR} to the postsynaptic density ({PSD)} based on the increased colocalization with the postsynaptic protein {PSD-95.} This finding together with increased binding of the {NR2B-subunit} specific ligand [{³H]-ifenprodil}, suggests increased targeting of {NR2B-NMDARs} to dendritic spines as a result of Pb²+ exposure. During brain development, there is a shift of {NR2B-} to {NR2A-containing} {NMDARs.} Our findings suggest that Pb²+ exposure impairs or delays this developmental switch at the level of the synapse. Finally, we show that alter expression of {NMDAR} complexes in the dendritic spine is most likely due to {NMDAR} inhibition, as exposure to the {NMDAR} antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid ({APV)} had similar effects as Pb²+ exposure. These data suggest that {NMDAR} inhibition by Pb²+ during synaptogensis alters {NMDAR} synapse development, which may have lasting consequences on downstream signaling.},

@article{zhang_ipad:_2012,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Next-Generation Sequencing ({NGS)} technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies ({GWAS)} generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the {NGS} and {GWAS.} Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).


{RESULTS}

We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis ({IPAD}, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data {sources.IPAD} is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the {BioCarta}, {KEGG}, {NCI-Nature} curated, Reactome, {CTD}, {PharmGKB}, {DrugBank}, {PharmGKB}, and {HOMER.} The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and {organ.Moreover}, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{IPAD} is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current {IPAD} database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.},

Cross-platform utilization of data from different technologies has the potential to reduce the need to duplicate experiments but requires corresponding measurements to be comparable. {METHODS:} A comparison of {mRNA} measurements of 2895 sequence-matched genes in 56 cell lines from the standard panel of 60 cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute ({NCI} 60) was carried out by calculating correlation between matched measurements and calculating concordance between cluster from two high-throughput {DNA} microarray technologies, Stanford type {cDNA} microarrays and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. {RESULTS:} In general, corresponding measurements from the two platforms showed poor correlation. Clusters of genes and cell lines were discordant between the two technologies, suggesting that relative intra-technology relationships were not preserved. {GC-content}, sequence length, average signal intensity, and an estimator of cross-hybridization were found to be associated with the degree of correlation. This suggests gene-specific, or more correctly probe-specific, factors influencing measurements differently in the two platforms, implying a poor prognosis for a broad utilization of gene expression measurements across platforms.},

Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of single gene intellectual disability ({ID)} and is frequently associated with autism. Our results suggest that dfmr1 mutants are less active than wild-type flies and interact with each other less often. In addition, mutants for one allele of dfmr1, dfmr1(B55), are more likely to come in close contact with a wild-type fly than another dfmr1(B55) mutant. Our results raise the possibility of defective social expression with preserved receptive abilities. We further suggest that the assay may be applied in a general strategy of examining endophenoypes of complex human neurological disorders in Drosophila, and specifically in order to understand the genetic basis of social interaction defects linked with {ID.}},

In this review, we summarize genetic, epigenetic and environmental contributions to neurodevelopmental alterations that either cause or confer vulnerability to autism, a disease primarily affecting social cognition.

Developed through the application of sigmoidal mathematics to {SYBR} Green I-based assays, target quantity is derived directly from fluorescence readings within the central region of an amplification profile. However, a major challenge of implementing {LRE} quantification is the labor intensive nature of the analysis.

Utilizing the extensive resources that are available for developing Java-based software, the {LRE} Analyzer was written using the {NetBeans} {IDE}, and is built on top of the modular architecture and windowing system provided by the {NetBeans} Platform. This fully featured desktop application determines the number of target molecules within a sample with little or no intervention by the user, in addition to providing extensive database capabilities. {MS} Excel is used to import data, allowing {LRE} quantification to be conducted with any real-time {PCR} instrument that provides access to the raw fluorescence readings. An extensive help set also provides an in-depth introduction to {LRE}, in addition to guidelines on how to implement {LRE} quantification.

The {LRE} Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data storage capabilities required by large-scale {qPCR} projects wanting to exploit the many advantages of absolute quantification. Foremost is the universal perspective afforded by absolute quantification, which among other attributes, provides the ability to directly compare quantitative data produced by different assays and/or instruments. Furthermore, absolute quantification has important implications for gene expression profiling in that it provides the foundation for comparing transcript quantities produced by any gene with any other gene, within and between samples.},

@article{cox_transcription_1991,
	Abstract = {The normal growth, development and function of an organism requires precise and co-ordinated control of gene expression. A major part of this control is exerted by regulating messenger {RNA} ({mRNA)} production and involves complex interactions between an array of transcriptionally active proteins and specific regulatory {DNA} sequences. The combination of such proteins and {DNA} sequences is specific for given gene or group of genes in a particular cell type and the proteins regulating the same gene may vary between cell types. In addition the expression or activity of these regulatory proteins may be modified depending on the state of differentiation of a cell or in response to an external stimulus. Thus, the differentiation of embryonic cells into diverse tissues is achieved and the mature structure and function of the organism is maintained. This review focusses on the role of perturbations of these transcriptional controls in neoplasia. Deregulation of transcription may result in the failure to express genes responsible for cellular differentiation, or alternatively, in the transcription of genes involved in cell division, through the inappropriate expression or activation of positively acting transcription factors and nuclear oncogenes. Whether the biochemical abnormalities that lead to the disordered growth and differentiation of a malignant tumour affect cell surface receptors, membrane or cytoplasmic signalling proteins or nuclear transcription factors, the end result is the inappropriate expression of some genes and failure to express others. Current research is starting to elucidate which of the elements of this complicated system are important in neoplasia.},

	Abstract = {By changing the conditioned discrimination paradigm of Quinn et al. (1974) from an instrumental procedure to a classical (Pavlovian) one, we have demonstrated strong learning in wildtype flies. About 150 flies were sequestered in a closed chamber and trained by exposing them sequentially to two odors in air currents. Flies received twelve electric shock pulses in the presence of the first odor ({CS+)} but not in the presence of the second odor ({CS-).} To test for conditioned avoidance responses, flies were transported to a T-maze choice point, between converging currents of the two odors. Typically, 95\% of trained flies avoided the shock-associated odor ({CS+).} Acquisition of learning was a function of the number of shock pulses received during {CS+} presentation and was asymptotic within one training cycle. Conditioned avoidance increased with increasing shock intensity or odor concentration and was very resistant to extinction. Learning was best when {CS+} presentations overlap shock (delay conditioning) and then decreased with increasing {CS-US} interstimulus intervals. Shocking flies immediately before {CS+} presentation (backward conditioning) produced no learning. Nonassociative control procedures ({CS} Alone, {US} Alone and Explicitly Unpaired) produced slight decreases in avoidance responses, but these affected both odors equally and did not alter our associative learning index (A). Memory in wild-type flies decayed gradually over the first seven hours after training and still was present 24 h later. The mutants amnesiac, rutabaga and dunce showed appreciable learning acquisition, but their memories decayed very rapidly during the first 30 min. After this, the rates of decay slowed sharply; conditioned avoidance still was measureable at least three hours after training.},

One piece of information is of interest when the dynamics reaches a steady state. In this paper we develop tools that enable the detection of steady states that are modeled by fixed points in discrete finite dynamical systems. We discuss two algebraic models, a univariate model and a multivariate model. We show that these two models are equivalent and that one can be converted to the other by means of a discrete Fourier transform. We give a new, more general definition of a linear finite dynamical system and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for such a system to be a fixed point system, that is, all cycles are of length one. We show how this result for generalized linear systems can be used to determine when certain nonlinear systems (monomial dynamical systems over finite fields) are fixed point systems. We also show how it is possible to determine in polynomial time when an ordinary linear system (defined over a finite field) is a fixed point system. We conclude with a necessary condition for a univariate finite dynamical system to be a fixed point system.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies (Alizadeh et al, [1]; Bittner et al,[5]; Golub et al, [11]) demonstrate the discovery of putative disease subtypes from gene expression data. The underlying computational problem is to partition the set of sample tissues into statistically meaningful classes. In this paper we present a novel approach to class discovery and develop automatic analysis methods. Our approach is based on statistically scoring candidate partitions according to the overabundance of genes that separate the different classes. Indeed, in biological datasets, an overabundance of genes separating known classes is typically observed. we measure overabundance against a stochastic null model. This allows for highlighting subtle, yet meaningful, partitions that are supported on a small subset of the genes.
Using simulated annealing we explore the space of all possible partitions of the set of samples, seeking partitions with statistically significant overabundance of differentially expressed genes. We demonstrate the performance of our methods on synthetic data, where we recover planted partitions. Finally, we turn to tumor expression datasets, and show that we find several highly pronounced partitions.},

	Abstract = {Inference of biological networks has become an important tool in Systems Biology. Nowadays it is becoming clearer that the complexity of organisms is more related with the organization of its components in networks rather than with the individual behaviour of the components. Among various approaches for inferring networks, Bayesian Networks are very attractive due to their probabilistic nature and flexibility to incorporate interventions and extra sources of information. Recently various attempts to infer networks with different Bayesian Networks approaches were pursued. The specific interest in this paper is to compare the performance of three different inference approaches: Bayesian Networks without any modification; Bayesian Networks modified to take into account specific interventions produced during data collection; and a probabilistic hierarchical model that allows the inclusion of extra knowledge in the inference of Bayesian Networks. The inference is performed in three different types of data: (i) synthetic data obtained from a Gaussian distribution, (ii) synthetic data simulated with Netbuilder and (iii) Real data obtained in flow cytometry experiments.},

However, the precise role of {FOXA1} in prostate cancer ({PC)} remains unknown. In this study, we report that {FOXA1} plays a critical role in {PC} cell proliferation. The expression of {FOXA1} was higher in {PC} than in normal prostate tissues (P = 0.0002), and, using immunohistochemical analysis, we found that {FOXA1} was localized in the nucleus. {FOXA1} expression levels were significantly correlated with both {PSA} and Gleason scores (P = 0.016 and P = 0.031, respectively). Moreover, {FOXA1} up-regulation was a significant factor in {PSA} failure (P = 0.011). Depletion of {FOXA1} in a prostate cancer cell line ({LNCaP)} using small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA)} significantly inhibited {AR} activity, led to cell-growth suppression, and induced {G0/G1} arrest. The anti-proliferative effect of {FOXA1} {siRNA} was mediated through insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 ({IGFBP-3).} An increase in {IGFBP-3}, mediated by depletion of {FOXA1}, inhibited phosphorylation of {MAPK} and Akt, and increased expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p27. We also found that the anti-proliferative effect of {FOXA1} depletion was significantly reversed by simultaneous {siRNA} depletion of {IGFBP-3.} These findings provide direct physiological and molecular evidence for a role of {FOXA1} in controlling cell proliferation through the regulation of {IGFBP-3} expression in {PC.}},

@article{ishak_systematic_2011,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Several prostate cancer genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)} have identified risk-associated genetic variants primarily in populations of European descent. Less is known about the association of these variants in high-risk populations, including men of African descent and men with a family history of prostate cancer. This article provides a detailed review of published studies of prostate cancer-associated genetic variants originally identified in {GWAS} and replicated in high-risk populations.


{METHODS}

Articles replicating {GWAS} findings (National Human Genome Research Institute {GWAS} database) were identified by searching {PubMed} and relevant data were extracted.


{RESULTS}

Eleven replication studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. Of more than 30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP)} identified in prostate cancer {GWAS}, 19 {SNPs} (63\%) were replicated in men of African descent and 10 {SNPs} (33\%) were replicated in men with familial and/or hereditary prostate cancer ({FPC/HPC).} The majority of {SNPs} were located at the 8q24 region with modest effect sizes ({OR} 1.11-2.63 in African American men and {OR} 1.3-2.51 in men with {FPC).} All replicated {SNPs} at 8q24 among men of African descent were within or near regions 2 and 3.


{CONCLUSIONS}

This systematic review revealed several {GWAS} markers with replicated associations with prostate cancer in men of African descent and men with {FPC/HPC.} The 8q24 region continues to be the most implicated in prostate cancer risk. These replication data support ongoing study of clinical utility and potential function of these prostate cancer-associated variants in high-risk men.


{IMPACT}

The replicated {SNPs} presented in this review hold promise for personalizing risk assessment for prostate cancer for high-risk men upon further study.},

Given recent results from admixture mapping and genome-wide association studies for {PCa} in {AA} men, it is clear that many risk alleles are enriched in men with West African genetic {ancestry.Methods:A} total of 77 ancestry informative markers ({AIMs)} within surrounding candidate gene regions were genotyped and haplotyped using Pyrosequencing in 358 unrelated men enrolled in a {PCa} genetic association study at the Howard University Hospital between 2000 and 2004. Sequence analysis of promoter region single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} to evaluate disruption of transcription factor-binding sites was conducted using in silico {methods.Results:Eight} {AIMs} were significantly associated with {PCa} risk after adjusting for age and West African ancestry. {SNP} rs1993973 (intervening sequences) had the strongest association with {PCa} using the log-additive genetic model (P=0.002). {SNPs} rs1561131 (genotypic, P=0.007), rs1963562 (dominant, P=0.01) and rs615382 (recessive, P=0.009) remained highly significant after adjusting for both age and ancestry. We also tested the independent effect of each significantly associated {SNP} and rs1561131 (P=0.04) and rs1963562 (P=0.04) remained significantly associated with {PCa} development. After multiple comparisons testing using the false discovery rate, rs1993973 remained significant. Analysis of the rs156113-, rs1963562-rs615382l and rs1993973-rs585224 haplotypes revealed that the least frequently found haplotypes in this population were significantly associated with a decreased risk of {PCa} (P=0.032 and 0.0017, {respectively).Conclusions:The} approach for {SNP} selection utilized herein showed that {AIMs} may not only leverage increased linkage disequilibrium in populations to identify risk and protective alleles, but may also be informative in dissecting the biology of {PCa} and other health disparities.},

	Abstract = {Constantly improving gene expression profiling technologies are expected to provide understanding and insight into cancer-related cellular processes. Gene expression data is also expected to significantly aid in the development of efficient cancer diagnosis and classification platforms. In this work we examine three sets of gene expression data measured across sets of tumor(s) and normal clinical samples: The first set consists of 2,000 genes, measured in 62 epithelial colon samples (Alon et al., 1999). The second consists of approximately equal to 100,000 clones, measured in 32 ovarian samples (unpublished extension of data set described in Schummer et al. (1999)). The third set consists of approximately equal to 7,100 genes, measured in 72 bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (Golub et al, 1999). We examine the use of scoring methods, measuring separation of tissue type (e.g., tumors from normals) using individual gene expression levels. These are then coupled with high-dimensional classification methods to assess the classification power of complete expression profiles. We present results of performing leave-one-out cross validation ({LOOCV)} experiments on the three data sets, employing nearest neighbor classifier, {SVM} (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), {AdaBoost} (Freund and Schapire, 1997) and a novel clustering-based classification technique. As tumor samples can differ from normal samples in their cell-type composition, we also perform {LOOCV} experiments using appropriately modified sets of genes, attempting to eliminate the resulting bias. We demonstrate success rate of at least 90\% in tumor versus normal classification, using sets of selected genes, with, as well as without, cellular-contamination-related members. These results are insensitive to the exact selection mechanism, over a certain range.},

	Abstract = {Through human activity lead has become a serious environmental neurotoxin, known to affect activity levels, attention and both sensory and cognitive function in children. Study of lead would be facilitated by having a model system that could be manipulated easily and quickly. We find Drosophila melanogaster ideal as such, and we have been studying effects of lead on courtship, fecundity and locomotor activity. We raised Canton-S flies from eggs to adult day 6-7 on medium made with lead acetate solution (2-100 microgram/g), or with distilled water, and we measured adult body lead burdens by means of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ({ICP-MS).} To measure courtship effectiveness, five virgin females and five virgin males were transferred into an empty vial and the number of females that mated within 20min was recorded. To measure fecundity, all adult offspring from eggs produced by one female within 12 days of mating were counted. To measure locomotor activity, individual flies were transferred to a grid-labeled petri dish and the number of lines crossed in 30s was counted. The number of females mating within 20min was increased significantly by exposure to 2 or 8 microgram/g lead, and was decreased significantly by exposure to 20 or 50 microgram/g lead. Fecundity was increased significantly by exposure to 2 microgram/g lead, but was unaffected by exposure to 20 microgram/g lead. Locomotor activity was consistently higher for males than for females, and was significantly reduced only by exposure to 50 microgram/g lead, and then only for males. We thus defined for Drosophila a lowest observable effect level ({LOEL)} of 2 microgram/g lead, which is considerably lower than the doses shown previously to affect this animal. The dose-response curve was biphasic for the number of females mating within 20min, an example of hormesis, a non-linear response that has been reported for low levels of stressors as diverse as pollutants and radiation. We hope from further studies with Drosophila to understand better how lead affects the developing nervous system, and thus ultimately its effects on children.},

	Abstract = {Prolonged exposure to inorganic lead (Pb(2+)) during development has been shown to influence activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain, possibly by altering the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). To explore this possibility, we studied the effect of Pb(2+) exposure on [Ca(2+)](i) regulation and synaptic facilitation at the neuromuscular junction of larval Drosophila. Wild-type Drosophila ({CS)} were raised from egg stages through the third larval instar in media containing either 0 {microM}, 100 {microM} or 250 {microM} Pb(2+) and identified motor terminals were examined in late third-instar larvae. To compare resting [Ca(2+)](i) and the changes in [Ca(2+)](i) produced by impulse activity, the motor terminals were loaded with a Ca(2+) indicator, either Oregon Green 488 {BAPTA-1} ({OGB-1)} or fura-2 conjugated to a dextran. We found that rearing in Pb(2+) did not significantly change the resting [Ca(2+)](i) nor the Ca(2+) transient produced in synaptic boutons by single action potentials ({APs);} however, the Ca(2+) transients produced by 10 Hz and 20 Hz {AP} trains were larger in Pb(2+)-exposed boutons and decayed more slowly. For larvae raised in 250 {microM} Pb(2+), the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) during an {AP} train (20 Hz) was 29\% greater than in control larvae and the [Ca(2+)](i) decay tau was 69\% greater. These differences appear to result from reduced activity of the plasma membrane Ca(2+) {ATPase} ({PMCA)}, which extrudes Ca(2+) from these synaptic terminals. These findings are consistent with studies in mammals showing a Pb(2+)-dependent reduction in {PMCA} activity. We also observed a Pb(2+)-dependent enhancement of synaptic facilitation at these larval neuromuscular synapses. Facilitation of {EPSP} amplitude during {AP} trains (20 Hz) was 55\% greater in Pb(2+)-reared larvae than in controls. These results showed that Pb(2+) exposure produced changes in the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) during impulse activity, which could affect various aspects of nervous system development. At the mature synapse, this altered [Ca(2+)](i) regulation produced changes in synaptic facilitation that are likely to influence the function of neural networks.},

@article{hirth_homeotic_1998,
	Abstract = {Studies in vertebrates show that homeotic genes are involved in axial patterning and in specifying segmental identity of the embryonic hindbrain and spinal cord. To gain further insights into homeotic gene action during {CNS} development, we here characterize the role of the homeotic genes in embryonic brain development of Drosophila. We first use neuroanatomical techniques to map the entire anteroposterior order of homeotic gene expression in the Drosophila {CNS}, and demonstrate that this order is virtually identical in the {CNS} of Drosophila and mammals. We then carry out a genetic analysis of the labial gene in embryonic brain development. Our analysis shows that loss-of-function mutation and ubiquitous overexpression of labial results in ectopic expression of neighboring regulatory genes. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that mutational inactivation of labial results in regionalized axonal patterning defects which are due to both cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous effects. Thus, in the absence of labial, mutant cells are generated and positioned correctly in the brain, but these cells do not extend axons. Additionally, extending axons of neighboring wild-type neurons stop at the mutant domains or project ectopically, and defective commissural and longitudinal pathways result. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrates that cells in the mutant domains do not express neuronal markers, indicating a complete lack of neuronal identity. An alternative glial identity is not adopted by these mutant cells. Comparable effects are seen in Deformed mutants but not in other homeotic gene mutants. Our findings demonstrate that the action of the homeotic genes labial and Deformed are required for neuronal differentiation in the developing brain of Drosophila.},

	Abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study {mRNA} expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney {RNA} samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same {RNA} samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each {mRNA} sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have detected more than 30 inherited prostate cancer risk variants. While clearly associated with risk, their relationship with clinical outcome, particularly prostate cancer--specific mortality, is less well known. We investigated whether the risk variants are associated with various measures of disease aggressiveness and prostate cancer--specific mortality. In a cohort of 3,945 men of European ancestry with prostate cancer, we genotyped 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP):} 35 known prostate cancer risk variants and one {SNP} (rs4054823) that was recently reported to be associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness. The majority of subjects had a diagnosis of prostate cancer between 1995 and 2004, and the cohort included a total of 580 prostate cancer--specific deaths. We evaluated associations between the 36 polymorphisms and prostate cancer survival, as well as other clinical parameters including age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen ({PSA)} at diagnosis, and Gleason score. Two {SNPs}, rs2735839 at chromosome 19q13 and rs7679673 at 4q24, were associated with prostate cancer--specific survival (P = 7 × 10−4 and 0.014, respectively). A total of 12 {SNPs} were associated with other variables (P {\textless} 0.05): age at diagnosis, {PSA} at diagnosis, Gleason score, and/or disease aggressiveness based on {D'Amico} criteria. Genotype status at rs4054823 was not associated with aggressiveness or outcome. Our results identify two common polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer--specific mortality.

@article{wu_gmap:_????,
	Abstract = {Motivation: We introduce gmap, a standalone program for mapping and aligning {cDNA} sequences to a genome. The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate alignment, sandwich {DP} for splice site detection, and microexon identification with statistical significance {testing.Results:} On a set of human messenger {RNAs} with random mutations at a 1 and 3\% rate, gmap identified all splice sites accurately in over 99.3\% of the sequences, which was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set of human expressed sequence tags, gmap provided higher-quality alignments more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis {cDNAs}, gmap performed comparably with {GeneSeqer.} In these experiments, gmap demonstrated a several-fold increase in speed over existing {programs.Availability:} Source code for gmap and associated programs is available at {http://www.gene.com/share/gmapContact:} {twu@gene.comSupplementary} information: http://www.gene.com/share/gmap},

@article{audesirk_effects_1991,
	Abstract = {{N1E-115} mouse neuroblastoma cells have been reported to possess two types of voltage-sensitive calcium channels: Low voltage activated, rapidly inactivating T-type (type I) and high voltage activated, slowly inactivating L-type (type {II).} We studied the effects of acute in vitro exposure to inorganic lead on these calcium channels, using the whole-cell variant of patch clamping. Using salines with a high lead-buffering capacity, we found that both T-type and L-type channels are reversibly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner at free Pb2+ concentrations ranging from 20 {nM} to 14 {microM.} L-type channels are somewhat more sensitive to Pb2+ than T-type channels are (L-type: {IC50} approx. 0.7 {microM;} T-type: {IC50} approx. 1.3 {microM).} Both channels show small but significant inhibition (approx. 10\%) at 20 {nM} free Pb2+. Pb2+ affects neither activation nor inactivation of T-type channels, but enhances inactivation of L-type channels at holding potentials around -60 to -40 {mV.} A peculiar phenomenon was observed in cells exposed to 2.3 {microM} free Pb2+. T-type channels were inhibited in all 20 cells studied. In 15 cells, L-type channels were also inhibited, but in the remaining 5 cells, current flow through L-type channels was enhanced by Pb2+ exposure.},

	Abstract = {The sporadic nature of Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} argues for an environmental link that may drive {AD} pathogenesis; however, the triggering factors and the period of their action are unknown. Recent studies in rodents have shown that exposure to lead (Pb) during brain development predetermined the expression and regulation of the amyloid precursor protein ({APP)} and its amyloidogenic beta-amyloid (Abeta) product in old age. Here, we report that the expression of {AD-related} genes [{APP}, {BACE1} (beta-site {APP} cleaving enzyme 1)] as well as their transcriptional regulator (Sp1) were elevated in aged (23-year-old) monkeys exposed to Pb as infants. Furthermore, developmental exposure to Pb altered the levels, characteristics, and intracellular distribution of Abeta staining and amyloid plaques in the frontal association cortex. These latent effects were accompanied by a decrease in {DNA} methyltransferase activity and higher levels of oxidative damage to {DNA}, indicating that epigenetic imprinting in early life influenced the expression of {AD-related} genes and promoted {DNA} damage and pathogenesis. These data suggest that {AD} pathogenesis is influenced by early life exposures and argue for both an environmental trigger and a developmental origin of {AD.}},

Affymetrix {GeneChip} arrays are the most popular. In this technology each gene is typically represented by a set of 11-20 pairs of probes. In order to obtain expression measures it is necessary to summarize the probe level data. Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models. In particular, improvements in the ability to detect differentially expressed genes are demonstrated.},

In contrast to vertebrate central synapses, each presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle cell is unique and identifiable, and the wiring circuit is invariant. Thus, the full power of Drosophila genetics can be brought to bear on a single, reproducibly identifiable, synaptic terminal. Each individual neuromuscular junction encompasses hundreds of synaptic neurotransmitter release sites housed in a chain of synaptic boutons. Recent advances have increased our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the development of both individual synapses--that is, the transmitter release sites including active zones and their apposed glutamate receptor clusters--and the whole synaptic terminal that connects a pre- and post-synaptic cell.},

@article{liang_reveal_1998,
	Abstract = {Given the immanent gene expression mapping covering whole genomes during development, health and disease, we seek computational methods to maximize functional inference from such large data sets. Is it possible, in principle, to completely infer a complex regulatory network architecture from input/output patterns of its variables? We investigated this possibility using binary models of genetic networks. Trajectories, or state transition tables of Boolean nets, resemble time series of gene expression. By systematically analyzing the mutual information between input states and output states, one is able to infer the sets of input elements controlling each element or gene in the network. This process is unequivocal and exact for complete state transition tables. We implemented this {REVerse} Engineering {ALgorithm} ({REVEAL)} in a C program, and found the problem to be tractable within the conditions tested so far. For n = 50 (elements) and k = 3 (inputs per element), the analysis of incomplete state transition tables (100 state transition pairs out of a possible 10(15)) reliably produced the original rule and wiring sets. While this study is limited to synchronous Boolean networks, the algorithm is generalizable to include multi-state models, essentially allowing direct application to realistic biological data sets. The ability to adequately solve the inverse problem may enable in-depth analysis of complex dynamic systems in biology and other fields.},

	Abstract = {Enormous effort has been focused over the last decade and a half on characterizing the behavioral effects of lead in the developing organism. While age-appropriate standardized measures of intelligence ({IQ)} have been the dependent variable most often used to assess lead-induced cognitive impairment in epidemiologic studies, researchers have also used a variety of other methods designed to assess specific behavioral processes sensitive to lead. Increased reaction time and poorer performance on vigilance tasks associated with increased lead body burden suggest increased distractibility and short attention span. Assessment of behavior on teachers' rating scales identified increased distractibility, impulsivity, nonpersistence, inability to follow sequences of directions, and inappropriate approach to problems as hallmarks of lead exposure. Robust deficits in learned skills such as reading, spelling, math, and word recognition have also been found. Spatial organizational perception and abilities seem particularly sensitive to lead-induced impairment. Assessment of complex tasks of learning and memory in both rats and monkeys has revealed overall deficits in function over a variety of behavioral tasks. Exploration of behavioral mechanisms responsible for these deficits identified increased distractibility perseveration, inability to inhibit inappropriate responding, and inability to change response strategy as underlying deficits. Thus, there is remarkable congruence between the epidemiologic and experimental literatures with regard to the behavioral processes identified as underlying the deficits inflicted by developmental lead exposure. However, careful behavioral analysis was required from researchers in both fields for such understanding to emerge.},

Notably, each {MPM} had a different mutation profile, and no mutated gene was previously implicated in {MPM.} Of the seven point mutations, three were observed in at least one tumor from 49 other {MPM} patients.

	Abstract = {Normalization means to adjust microarray data for effects which arise from variation in the technology rather than from biological differences between the {RNA} samples or between the printed probes. This paper describes normalization methods based on the fact that dye balance typically varies with spot intensity and with spatial position on the array. Print-tip loess normalization provides a well-tested general purpose normalization method which has given good results on a wide range of arrays. The method may be refined by using quality weights for individual spots. The method is best combined with diagnostic plots of the data which display the spatial and intensity trends. When diagnostic plots show that biases still remain in the data after normalization, further normalization steps such as plate-order normalization or scale-normalization between the arrays may be undertaken. Composite normalization may be used when control spots are available which are known to be not differentially expressed. Variations on loess normalization include global loess normalization and two-dimensional normalization. Detailed commands are given to implement the normalization techniques using freely available software.},

{BACKGROUND}

{RNA} sequencing is a flexible and powerful new approach for measuring gene, exon, or isoform expression. To maximize the utility of {RNA} sequencing data, new statistical methods are needed for clustering, differential expression, and other analyses. A major barrier to the development of new statistical methods is the lack of {RNA} sequencing datasets that can be easily obtained and analyzed in common statistical software packages such as R. To speed up the development process, we have created a resource of analysis-ready {RNA-sequencing} datasets. 2


{DESCRIPTION}

{ReCount} is an online resource of {RNA-seq} gene count tables and auxilliary data. Tables were built from raw {RNA} sequencing data from 18 different published studies comprising 475 samples and over 8 billion reads. Using the Myrna package, reads were aligned, overlapped with gene models and tabulated into gene-by-sample count tables that are ready for statistical analysis. Count tables and phenotype data were combined into Bioconductor {ExpressionSet} objects for ease of analysis. {ReCount} also contains the Myrna manifest files and R source code used to process the samples, allowing statistical and computational scientists to consider alternative parameter values. 3


{CONCLUSIONS}

By combining datasets from many studies and providing data that has already been processed from. fastq format into ready-to-use. {RData} and. txt files, {ReCount} facilitates analysis and methods development for {RNA-seq} count data. We anticipate that {ReCount} will also be useful for investigators who wish to consider cross-study comparisons and alternative normalization strategies for {RNA-seq.}},

	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} In the Affymetrix {GeneChip} system, preprocessing occurs before one obtains expression level measurements. Because the number of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. {RESULTS:} We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a {U95A} dataset of spike in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older {U95A} array, although different experiments on more current arrays may benchmark differently. {AVAILABILITY:} The affycomp package, now version 1.5.2, continues to be available as part of the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org).

@article{ortiz-pineda_gene_2009,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Among deuterostomes, the regenerative potential is maximally expressed in echinoderms, animals that can quickly replace most injured organs. In particular, sea cucumbers are excellent models for studying organ regeneration since they regenerate their digestive tract after evisceration. However, echinoderms have been sidelined in modern regeneration studies partially because of the lack of genome-wide profiling approaches afforded by modern genomic {tools.For} the last decade, our laboratory has been using the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima to dissect the cellular and molecular events that allow for such amazing regenerative processes. We have already established an {EST} database obtained from {cDNA} libraries of normal and regenerating intestine at two different regeneration stages. This database now has over 7000 sequences.


{RESULTS}

In the present work we used a custom-made microchip from Agilent with 60-mer probes for these {ESTs}, to determine the gene expression profile during intestinal regeneration. Here we compared the expression profile of animals at three different intestinal regeneration stages (3-, 7- and 14-days post evisceration) against the profile from normal (uneviscerated) intestines. The number of differentially expressed probes ranged from 70\% at p {\textless} 0.05 to 39\% at p {\textless} 0.001. Clustering analyses show specific profiles of expression for early (first week) and late (second week) regeneration stages. We used semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ({RT-PCR)} to validate the expression profile of fifteen microarray detected differentially expressed genes which resulted in over 86\% concordance between both techniques. Most of the differentially expressed {ESTs} showed no clear similarity to sequences in the databases and might represent novel genes associated with regeneration. However, other {ESTs} were similar to genes known to be involved in regeneration-related processes, wound healing, cell proliferation, differentiation, morphological plasticity, cell survival, stress response, immune challenge, and neoplastic transformation. Among those that have been validated, cytoskeletal genes, such as actins, and developmental genes, such as Wnt and Hox genes, show interesting expression profiles during regeneration.


{CONCLUSION}

Our findings set the base for future studies into the molecular basis of intestinal regeneration. Moreover, it advances the use of echinoderms in regenerative biology, animals that because of their amazing properties and their key evolutionary position, might provide important clues to the genetic basis of regenerative processes.},

	Abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

@article{dimitrova_discretization_2010,
	Abstract = {An increasing number of algorithms for biochemical network inference from experimental data require discrete data as input. For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other-a time-and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, {SSD.} {SSD} is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with {SSD} than with the other methods. In addition, {SSD} is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of {SSD} is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .},

@article{zawia_environmental_2005,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose clinical manifestations appear in old age. The hallmark pathological features of {AD} (amyloid plaques and associated proteins) are present in normal aging indivduals, suggesting that {AD} may result from the acceleration of normal age-related processes in the brain. The sporadic nature of most {AD} cases strongly argues for an environmental link that may drive {AD} pathogenesis; however, it is unclear when this environmental stress may occur. Therefore it is important to identify an environmental trigger(s) and to pinpoint the period during which such factors pose the greatest risk. Recently, we reported that developmental exposure of rats to the xenobiotic metal lead (Pb) resulted in a delayed overexpression (20 months later) of the amyloid precursor protein ({APP)} and its amyloidogenic Abeta product. Similarly, aged monkeys exposed to Pb as infants also responded in the same way. These data suggest that environmental influences occurring during brain development predetermine the expression and regulation of {APP} later in life, potentially influencing the course of amyloidogenesis, and argue for both an environmental trigger and a developmental origin of {AD.} In this review, we present evidence for the developmental basis of neurodegeneration and discuss mechanisms that may explain how perturbations during development can have long-term or delayed consequences in the aging brain.},

Results: We discuss the capabilities of {GOstats}, a Bioconductor package written in R, that allows users to test {GO} terms for over or under-representation using either a classical hypergeometric test or a conditional hypergeometric that uses the relationships among {GO} terms to decorrelate the results.
Availability: {GOstats} is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org

	Abstract = {Long term or chronic exposure to lead is associated with cognitive and other deficits in humans, which may reflect lead-induced changes in synaptic development and function. We believe that Drosophila has great potential as a model system for studying such changes. To test this, we compared the structure of single, identified synapses between identified axons (axons 1 and 2) and muscle fibers (fibers 6 and 7) in untreated 3rd instar larvae, and in larvae reared on medium made with 100 {microM} lead acetate in distilled water. We used three approaches to examine the motor terminals on muscle fibers 6 and 7 in segment 2: (1) all terminals were stained with an antibody to {HRP;} (2) only the terminals of axon 1 were stained by injecting biotinylated Lucifer yellow into it; and (3) the regions of the terminal containing synaptic vesicles were stained with an antibody to synaptotagmin, which provides an estimate of "synaptic" terminal area. Lead burdens were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; hemolymph lead levels at the neuromuscular junction were likely to be micromolar. We observed that lead exposure did not significantly affect the average terminal area or the average muscle fiber area, but did significantly affect the uniformity of the matching between muscle area and motor terminal size that normally occurs during development. There was a significant positive correlation between motor terminal size and muscle area in control, but not in lead-exposed larvae. The sensitivity of Drosophila larval synaptic development to lead opens the way to using the powerful genetic and molecular tools available for this system to study the underlying mechanisms of this sensitivity. We would hope that from such an understanding may come strategies for dealing with lead-induced deficits in children.},

	Abstract = {1. Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant which has been reported to have growth-retarding effects. That premise was examined in the current study of the effects of developmental exposure to Pb on the maturation of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. 2. Flies were raised from egg to adulthood in media to which 0, 100, 250, or 500 ppm Pb acetate added. 3. There was a dose-dependent delay of maturation but no apparent effect on survival to adulthood. There were no significant differences in this effect between male and female flies. 4. Weights of fly offspring and their fecundity were not related to increasing exposure levels, suggesting that the delays were not due to gross nutritional deficits. 5. Analyses of Pb content indicated exposure-dependent body burdens of Pb in flies. Timed analyses of the Pb content of media itself indicated a heterogeneous distribution of Pb in the media, suggesting some precipitation of Pb at the highest exposure, occurring primarily during the first hour. 6. The mechanistic bases of the Pb-induced retardation of D. melanogaster development remain unknown, but it is concluded that because of the extensive body of knowledge on D. melanogaster genetics, molecular biology, and developmental biology, this procedure could serve as a model system for further study of the developmental consequences of exposure to Pb or other toxicants. 7. Environmental Pb exposure resulting in retarded development could have deleterious repercussions for insect populations exposed chronically to high levels of Pb.},

Various studies have been published comparing competing platforms with mixed results: some find agreement, others do not.

Here we present results from a comparison study that offers important improvements over those previously described in the literature. In particular, we noticed that none of the previously published papers consider differences between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories from the Washington, {DC-Baltimore}, {USA}, area was formed to compare data obtained from three widely used platforms using identical {RNA} samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis to demonstrate that there are relatively large differences in data obtained in labs using the same platform, but that the results from the best-performing labs agree rather well.},

The genetic and neural circuit bases of these innate social behaviors are poorly understood. High-throughput behavioral screening in this genetically tractable model organism is a potentially powerful approach, but it is currently very laborious. Our system monitors interacting pairs of flies and computes their location, orientation and wing posture. These features are used for detecting behaviors exhibited during aggression and courtship. Among these, wing threat, lunging and tussling are specific to aggression; circling, wing extension (courtship 'song') and copulation are specific to courtship; locomotion and chasing are common to both. Ethograms may be constructed automatically from these measurements, saving considerable time and effort. This technology should enable large-scale screens for genes and neural circuits controlling courtship and aggression.},

@article{rand_drosophotoxicology:_2010,
	Abstract = {Understanding neurotoxic mechanisms is a challenge of deciphering which genes and gene products in the developing or mature nervous system are targeted for disruption by chemicals we encounter in our environment. Our understanding of nervous system development and physiology is highly advanced due in large part to studies conducted in simple non-mammalian models. The paucity of toxicological data for the more than 80,000 chemicals in commercial use today, and the approximately 2000 new chemicals introduced each year, makes development of sensitive and rapid assays to screen for neurotoxicity paramount. In this article I advocate the use of Drosophila in the modern regimen of toxicological testing, emphasizing its unique attributes for assaying neurodevelopment and behavior. Features of the Drosophila model are reviewed and a generalized overall scheme for its use in toxicology is presented. Examples of where the fly has proven fruitful in evaluating common toxicants in our environment are also highlighted. Attention is drawn to three areas where development and application of the fly model might benefit toxicology the most: 1) optimizing sensitive endpoints for pathway-specific screening, 2) accommodating high throughput demands for analysis of chemical toxicant libraries, 3) optimizing genetic and molecular protocols for more rapid identification toxicant-by-gene interactions. While there are shortcomings in the Drosophila model, which exclude it from effective toxicological testing in certain arenas, conservation of fundamental cellular and developmental mechanisms between flies and man is extensive enough to warrant a central role for the Drosophila model in toxicological testing of today.},
